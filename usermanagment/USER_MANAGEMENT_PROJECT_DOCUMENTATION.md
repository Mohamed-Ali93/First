## Best Prompts for AI Collaboration

### 1. Architecture and Design Prompts

**Effective Prompt:**
```
"I need to implement a user role management system in ABP Framework. The system should allow moving users between roles while keeping them in multiple roles. Please provide:
1. The service interface and implementation
2. Proper authorization setup
3. Unit of work pattern usage
4. Error handling and logging
5. DTOs for data transfer
Please follow ABP Framework conventions and best practices."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Specifies the framework (ABP)
- Defines clear requirements
- Requests specific deliverables
- Mentions best practices

### 2. Frontend Development Prompts

**Effective Prompt:**
```
"Create an Angular component for user role management with the following features:
1. Display roles with user counts
2. Modal dialog for moving users between roles
3. Form validation using Reactive Forms
4. Integration with ABP services
5. Error handling and loading states
6. Responsive design with Bootstrap
Please include TypeScript interfaces and proper error handling."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Specifies the framework (Angular)
- Lists specific features
- Mentions UI libraries (Bootstrap)
- Requests TypeScript types

### 3. Problem-Solving Prompts

**Effective Prompt:**
```
"I'm getting a 'User is already in role' error when trying to move users between roles. The issue occurs in the MoveUserToRoleAsync method. Here's the current code:
[PASTE CODE]
Please help me:
1. Identify the root cause
2. Provide a solution with proper validation
3. Add appropriate logging
4. Include unit tests for this scenario"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Describes the specific error
- Provides context and code
- Requests multiple aspects of solution
- Asks for testing

### 4. Code Review Prompts

**Effective Prompt:**
```
"Please review this ABP service implementation for:
1. Security vulnerabilities

Here's the code:
[PASTE CODE]"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Requests specific review areas
- Focuses on framework-specific concerns
- Asks for multiple perspectives

## Problems Faced and Solutions

### 1. Multi-Role Support Complexity

**Problem:**
- ABP Identity doesn't natively support moving users between roles while keeping them in multiple roles
- Need to implement custom logic for role management

**Solution:**
```csharp
// Instead of removing from source role, only add to target role
var result = await _userManager.AddToRoleAsync(user, targetRole.Name);
if (!result.Succeeded)
{
    var errors = string.Join(", ", result.Errors.Select(e => e.Description));
    throw new Exception($"Failed to add user to role: {errors}");
}
```

**Time Impact:** +2 days for custom implementation

### 2. Security Log Performance Issues

**Problem:**
- Large security log tables causing slow queries
- Need efficient filtering and pagination

**Solution:**
```csharp
// Implemented efficient querying with proper indexing
var query = queryable
    .WhereIf(input.UserId.HasValue, x => x.UserId == input.UserId)
    .WhereIf(!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input.UserName), x => x.UserName.Contains(input.UserName))
    .OrderBy(input.Sorting ?? nameof(IdentitySecurityLog.CreationTime) + " DESC")
    .PageBy(input);
```

**Time Impact:** +1 day for optimization

### 3. Frontend State Management

**Problem:**
- Complex state management for user-role relationships
- Need to refresh data after operations

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Implemented proper state management with service calls
moveUserToRole() {
  this.userManagmentService.moveUserToRole(moveDto).subscribe({
    next: () => {
      this.toasterService.success('User moved successfully!');
      this.loadUsersInRole(this.selectedRole.id); // Refresh data
    }
  });
}
```

**Time Impact:** +1 day for state management

### 4. Authorization and Permissions

**Problem:**
- Complex permission requirements for different operations
- Need granular access control

**Solution:**
```csharp
[Authorize(Permissions.UserManagmentPermissions.UserRoleManagement)]
public async Task MoveUserToRoleAsync(MoveUserToRoleDto input)
{
    // Implementation with proper authorization
}
```

**Time Impact:** +1 day for permission setup

### 5. Angular Module Integration

**Problem:**
- Integrating custom components with ABP Angular modules
- Dependency injection and service integration

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Proper module setup with ABP integration
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    ThemeSharedModule,
    IdentityModule,
    // Custom imports
  ],
  providers: [
    UserManagmentService,
    SecurityLogsService
  ]
})
```

**Time Impact:** +1 day for integration

### 6. Database Migration Issues

**Problem:**
- Entity Framework migrations for extended user fields
- Data consistency during updates

**Solution:**
```csharp
// Proper migration with data seeding
public partial class AddExtendedUserFields : Migration
{
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        // Migration logic with proper data handling
    }
}
```

**Time Impact:** +1 day for migration fixes
